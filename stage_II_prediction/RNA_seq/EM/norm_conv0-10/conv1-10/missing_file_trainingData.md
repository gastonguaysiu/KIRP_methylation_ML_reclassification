## MISSING FILES from RNA_seq data

** trainingData.csv** contains the normalize RNA_seq data of all the transcripts for patients samples that were used in training. Due to the nature of the algorithm a unique trainingData.csv file was create for each sequential convergence of the  biomarkers transcripts. In other words the trainingData fie for the e0 convergence contains all transcript rows for all the trainning samples, and conv1 contains a subset of the e0 version, which will be almost identical minus the converge transcripts of the first iteration (approximatly 28 sites). The trainingData.csv conv2 will contain a subset of the probes used in the conv1, which will be almost identical minus the converged transcripts (approximatly 37 probes). The pattern continue until the 10th convergence.

The file trainingData.csv is a comprehensive database for the methylation values (m-values) associated with all the CpG probes collected from samples from patients used for the training phase. Within the structure of our dataset, the e0_opt subfolder is the aggregating data from all CpG convergent sites (labelled conv1 through conv10). This process involves unifying their respective CpG site data and creating a consolidated dimensionality framework for application in K-means clustering algorithms.

Further refining the process, the opt subfolder emerges as a critical output derived from applying the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm a final time. This step begins with the dimensional framework established in the e0_opt subfolder as its starting point. The primary goal here is to sift through the extensive array of CpG probes, selecting a more focused subset. This refined selection is crucial for accurately determining the dimensionality that will be utilized to guide the clustering process in K-means clustering.

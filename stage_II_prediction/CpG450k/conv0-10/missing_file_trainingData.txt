trainingData.csv contains the m-values of all the CpG probes for the patients samples that were used in training. Due to the nature of the algorithm a unique trainingData.csv file was create for each sequential convergence on the CpG  biomarkers sites. In other words the trainingData fie for the e0 convergence contains all the CpG site for all the trainning samples, and conv1 contains a subset of the e0 version, which will be almost identical minus the converge probe of the first iteration (approximatly 28 sites). The trainingData.csv conv2 will contain a subset of the probes used in the conv1, which will be almost identical minus the converged probes (approximatly 37 probes). The pattern continue until the 10th convergence.

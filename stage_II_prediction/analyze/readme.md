An alternative analysis might focus on the addition data for the predictioned groupings for patients. However, the primary aim of the prediction algorithm was to categorize patients, not to examine differences between groups. Using all available samples for patient categorization would enhance the robustness of the results, compared to using only the 90% of samples that trained the predictive algorithm. Therefore, this analysis did not explore beyond the initial reclassification algorithm.
